# SimpleTimer
Quick and easy simple forms timer. Done while learning about C# forms.
## Setup
* Mostly just build and use, can add an optional alarm.wav file in the same folder as the executable to have sound go off when the timer ends.
## Controls
* Double-Click: Exit application (on the border only)
* Click and Drag: Move the timer (on the border only)
* Space: Pause/Stop the timer
* Enter: Start the timer
